She has told me about her interest in serving people in need many times in the past, but her work kept her too busy.

I teach 4th grade at Belle Sherman Elementary School and ""Mr. Dave"" has been a volunteer in my class for at least 6 years, maybe longer. We had to take a break when schools closed due to Covid and I taught virtually. Dave is smart, dependable, and culturally sensitive. I teach a diverse class with many students who are learning English. Mr. Dave is sensitive to their needs and great at fostering relationships and helping students with their school work. Mr. Dave enjoys solving tricky problems and developing projects and hands-on activities for the children. I think he would be equally good with older adults! Dave Stipanuk is kind, respectful, and helpful. Dave Stipanuk would be an asset to your organization.'
 'I met Mr. Dave, as he is known at Belle Sherman Elementary school, about 5-6 years ago. He would come into my 4th grade classroom multiple times a week to volunteer. \r\n\r\nMr. Dave was a jack of all trades in the classroom. He could lead groups of students in a variety of subjects (math, science, special students, reading, writing, you name it), he would work and tutor a student one on one, he would participate in whole class activities answering and asking questions and he was eager to help setup and clean up activities as well as grade student work. Literally however he could help, he would.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive thing about Mr. Dave was how willing he was to help solve a problem. It seems like every time he came in he would have a new idea about how to help a particular student or the entire class.\r\n\r\nI must admit he mostly worked with 10 year olds and even though his work with students went very well, I rarely observed him working with adults besides collaborating very well with me'
