I offered to drive to my house to get one and return to set up the TV but Jane just had her shingles shot yesterday wasn't feeling well.  The important item is working, as someone is getting her a phone for hard of hearing and that person needs the internet to install the phone.  She is moving in Saturday and next week or the week after will be a good time for me to return to set up the TV.  It shouldn't take long at all to do this.  As always, we'll work through you to set a time for me to go over for TV installation.  I drove Jane home to her current apartment and we had a good chat about history.  She grew up in New Mexico and has some nice tales of the remnants of the old west out there. (full report in email)"

The short answer is I failed and she will call her plumber.

Was able to easily remove the valve tops and look inside, but could not unscrew or pull the valve stem out from the top.
Looked like I would have needed to have detached the flexible piping and unscrew the valve from the bottom of the countertop.
I told her, that for such a small drip, I didn't want to introduce the chance of leaks that she couldn't see under the sink.

She got a drink at Greenstar in the DeWitt Building.  I suggested that she could have had orange juice or similar at Dr. Law's.  She said that she didn't feel low blood sugar then.

We are fast friends with hugs in both directions.
Quite a handful, but I have him sitting at each intersection and he responds well to a firm hand when he wants to go after dogs/cats/balls rolling in the street.
Doing a little jogging on straight sections in areas along walls (to avoid surprises) trying to get the energy out of him balanced with being mindful of the heat.
Returned him yesterday a relaxed happy dog.

Committed to walking him 6 days per week for the next 2 to 3 months.
Walked him last night and scheduled this week for M-F at 4pm."

Turned out that the visible corrosion here was only on the drain line and the shutoff was great.
After isolating the water, found that after removing the central cartridge of the hot water valve and cleaning out a ton of debris, that the valve would not stop passing water unless I pressed down on the valve stem.
The rubber washer in the base felt good. Asked them to take the central cartridge to the store and try a replacement.
Learned a bit on this one. Had never worked on more modern cheap plastic parts that just popped in instead of screwed in with threads.
2) Kitchen faucet has a leak.
Verified that the multiple leak points of the kitchen faucet require replacement.
They have a new one on site.
3) Outside faucet is leaking.
Found the leak on this faucet was only when it was open and leaking past the valve stem vs' they thought it was leaking at the connection to the hose...Suggested replacement"

'I went an looked at the windows yesterday. One was badly broken with parts like a broken spring literally falling out of it. Nothing I could do there. Fixed one by unbending one retention hole so they can have the outside glass stay up. Found strange greasy residue in a few windows and Kusum said she had been trying to lubricate with vegetable oil. Advised her to stop doing that and clean the tracks with a little Dawn dish washing liquid. Also found one window track filled with rocks from potted plant she kept in the window. Asked her to vacuum those out. Overall, none of the windows were stuck for me, but I did notice that the placement of objects in the room near the windows was extremely unhelpful to get leverage to use them...they were also trying to just open them by arm strength across their bodies with arm outstretched. Tried to demonstrate a whole-body opening strategy with the arm stationary and the legs/torso doing the work.'- Chris Dunham

A few days later Kent texted Diana stating that he had a few ideas for her railing project, Diana responded that she wasn't too concerned about the railings at this time.  Kent sent a second text some time later asking whether Diana was interested in meeting new people and if she would like to go for a walk sometime.  Diana never responded to this text and feels uncomfortable that he contacted her in this manner.  Dianna expressed her concern to Cassie Besemer and stated that she would not like Kent to assist her with any future projects and that she was concerned he may make similar advances with other women.

Natasha had a call from the agency that gives SNAP benefits to tell her that she had a lot of money accumulating on her SNAP card.  Natasha had no idea.  She wondered if I would take her card and pin and begin using it.  After Cheryl explained the process to me, I stopped at Natasha's before shopping yesterday and used the card at all three stores:  Aldi's, GreenStar, and Wegman's.  Not all items were covered.  Natasha gave me a check to cover them.  Shopping was a success.

I talked with her yesterday afternoon and got her shopping list.  I told her that I would shop today after 2:00 PM.  I expected to deliver her groceries at 3:30 PM or later.

I went to Aldi’s, Green Star, and Wegman’s shopping only for her with a long list.  Stores were fairly busy.  I finished at 4:00 PM and just got to my car when my cell rang.  Natasha was worried that something happened to me because I did not call her at 3:30 PM.  I tried to explain that I was fine.  She does not seem to process when I tell her that I am not sure when I will finish shopping.  This has happened before and I don’t know how to solve the problem.  At 94 I understand that she worries about everything.  

I called her back at 4:05 PM and delivered the groceries at 4:15 PM, getting home at 4:30 PM, too tired for Happy Hour.'-Carol Scheele

When we got to CMA, I went in with Randy to confirm that he did indeed have an appointment.  The receptionist said it was with Dr. Roche, not Dr. Blake.  When Randy was called into the examination area I inquired as to how long it would probably take. The medical assistant said that she didn’t know and that it would depend on what would be found by Dr. Roche.  End result: I stayed with Randy for his examination which went very well.

","As you know, he was discharged from Beechtree Friday morning.  When I picked him up at 2:45, he was quite proud of the fact that he was able to go shopping the same day as being released. He wasn’t too pleased with the Beechtree situation but managed to carry on.
When I arrived, I waved to him.  He was chatting with two others.  It was clearly hard for him to break off that conversation to get into the car, even though another vehicle was patiently waiting for us to move on.
When I picked him up at 3:40, he said that his shopping routine had been somewhat difficult.  The first young man assigned to him allegedly knew nothing about where particular items were located, and he was soon replaced by a much more helpful woman.
Our trip back to McGraw House was uneventful.  When we arrived, Randy said he would go in and get their shopping cart to take his goods up to his apartment.  I waited and waited.  Frankly, I thought he had met someone in the lobby and was chatting again.  Finally, a"

She is a pleasure to work for.","Michael Delwich was fabulous! He cleaned all my gutters, even the most inaccessible ones , and they all had hundreds of little maple trees growing in them. Then he disposed of the debris very neatly, so there was no mess at all. Then he actually dug out the no-account rose bush that had very nasty stickers and had 3 gnarly roots, so I am finally rid of it. I just have put down a huge piece of plastic, rake the pile of stickers onto it and drag it down to the overgrown area just over my fence. He also looked at the peeling hardboard near the roof and recommended his professional painter to me. I have lots of other overgrown bushes, but that was the really nasty one. At some point I need to have the greenish spots on my deck washed off and a new coat of paint put on. I used to do all that sort of stuff myself, but these days I wear out much too fast and also should not be climbing ladders anymore."

At 8:00 PM last night I called the main McGraw House number.  The person who answered said she would remind Randy if she saw him.

I tried to call Randy again this morning at 8:30 AM.  No answer.  I called Carrie to ask for advice.  I went to McGraw House and was not allowed in.  I tried their phone service and buzzing Randy’s room.  Nothing.
I waited outside.  About 9:20 AM, I saw Randy in the lobby.  He came outside and said he forgot all about Morning Buzz.  He went to his room, changed his shirt and got a jacket.

Randy said that he was quite forgetful at age 92.  He was in his room but never heard the phone ring.  He was going to have his son check his phone.  Randy apologized many times.  I took him to Purity, helped him get coffee, and departed.

She is having problems with iron bacteria and the best way to resolve this is to cleanse her cold water pipes in the house with chlorox. Then wash out the chlorine after 4-5 hours and then put in a chlorinator and possibly a carbon filter. I have the same problem and I solved my problem this way and have had no iron bacteria problems for 5 years!!

It looks like the neighbor/tenant from upstairs put clear caulk around the kitchen faucet to control the water, but that is directing the water behind and under the sink.

The doctors' office is not.  Joyce's appointment was scheduled for 11:30.  She didn't leave the waiting room until 12:30 and was not back out until 1:40 pm.  Joyce didn't realize that the appointment was for a physical and thus the appointment was longer, but stil....   Others were waiting for a lengthy time as well.  

Also, the receptionist was not welcoming or cognizant of Joyce's issues with eyesight.  She asked Joyce to fill out a 3 page questionnaire.  As Joyce said, her doctor knows her and knows her history.   The questionnaire asked questions of a very personal nature.  I kept asking Joyce if it was ok for me to help her, and she said yes, but I wasn't comfortable asking her about her sex for example.

I hadn't realized that Joyce needed me to stay with her and I had planned to do errands.   When the receptionist handed her the forms to fill out, I was very glad that I had stayed.  I did do a quick errand when  Joyce went into the examining room. "

After about half an hour he gets tired of talking so we head to the pool table.  I think we both are improving.  The place we go in AZ has a pool table in the club house..may have to practice a bit over the winter.

She did ask me if I knew of any work she could do since she seems to be lonely with few visitors and so would like to have something to do. But she does have some physical problems that prevent her doing some things like helping at the 'Friends of Library' and their French or Spanish sections. At the end I took her to vote and brought her back and she was very happy with this. I would worry about her being alone and falling, but her children need to address that. At the moment she seems to be stable on her feet. Just would like some visits and people to talk to. "

We did play pool for the last half hour..he beat me royally..we played by the rules..he had some great shots and seemed very pleased with himself..seemed to cheer him up.  

I can see some changes over the time I have been coming.. less able to remember and perhaps feeling more solemn about his situation and feeling badly for you, Jean, having to be there for him.  From my experience with Altzeimers, he might become less aware of his failings which may be a good thing in that way.  He is a terrific guy and it has been my pleasure to get to spend time with him.

What a difference from one week to the next. Dave was very upbeat about Dorothy's visit today - They had fun and he looks forward to more visits with her. Yay.  Rest assured, we are not moving. I mentioned that he probably will be going to the Adult Day Program at Lifelong this fall for one day a week if they have openings. I'm also looking into agency paid companion care. Life can be confusing. 

Dorothy, I'm happy for you to have our e-mail address.   schurman03@yahoo.com   Thank you for today's visit and your willingness to come again. Dave had a good time!

Jean
","Hi, I stayed for an hour and a half and it was fun., we talked then played pool.. he talked of some other agency or maybe he was moving.. not sure what that meant.. maybe nothing..I make sure he is sitting in his chair with his soda listening to music before I leave.  Can you forward this on to Jean.,or can I have her email so I can communicate directly?

Wag More, Bark Less

Dave is having a real hard time right now dealing with his Alzheimer's Disease and we have an appointment tomorrow with his doctor to see if perhaps a medication change is in order. It sounded to me like he and Dorothy had a nice time together, but he found it to be very over-whelming. We'll keep Dorothy in mind for other visits after the dust settles. She seems willing to work with us and I appreciate the caring and concern the both of you have shown us.

Jean
","So I just got back from my visit.. we decided I would come next Monday at 3 for an hour.  Dave has trouble expressing himself and I can see how difficult it would be to “entertain” someone for much longer.  So we shall see how it goes.. might Mary Helen like to do some time since she knows him and he knows her?

So Jean just called and said that Dave had had a bad morning before I came .. and it seemed too much for him to “entertain” me.. he felt as he should and used to do.  I was expecting to just sit and show him my pictures or chat about his life, but he had the game set up and felt he needed to be the host..so she said that they were going to the counselor and maybe change his meds and would get back to me if she thought it was time.

We tried.. I thought it went fine, but he felt exhausted even though I did not see it...so I guess he was a successful host if that was his goal.  He is stuck in a bad place for sure.

I plan to return to help with bills next wed the 18th from 1-3:30.
I did talk with Joyce yesterday about the time I can commit to which is about 3 hours each week to mostly help with mail and bills.  I can offer a little more time on occasion but not regularly. I think she had another person taking her out often and that has not been happening as much lately.  I suggested she call LLH to see if there might be someone available to help her with some of the errands.  
Joyce also shared that her vision has decreased a good deal in The past 6-8 weeks.  She has seen her doc regarding this and has someone coming soon to evaluate her needs at home.   I have seen a change in Her ability to see things .  I think she will need more support at home in the future for her to be safe.

Looked like an older valve with a consistent leak making a noticeable iceberg under the valve.
The one on another side of the house had already been changed out to a more modern one like another I repaired in the summer at another house. Took a peak in the larger part of the crawl space to try to trace the water line and find an interior isolation valve. No luck. Asked about shutting off the water to the whole house, but John didn't want to do that today (entertaining). I was very hesitant to touch the valve without a shutoff readily available.

John said he would put on some old clothes and go up in the crawlspace himself soon.

On 6/9/17 I went to see SP for a visit.  The smell of ammonia was quite strong when I entered.
SP was fine.  Said she had been snuggling her cat on the bed when I called.  The rugs are still covered in cat hair.  Not sure if the new cleaning service has started yet or not.
We went for a short walk.  Perhaps SP's nose picked up the odor when we reentered the apt.
Thankfully, SP opened the sliding glass door for the last 10 min of the visit.
I thought I could hang in as her visitor until the new cleaner had taken effect but I do not believe I can. 
In the interest of self care of my lungs, I would like to terminate my visits with her.  Perhaps you can find someone who does not have such a sensitive nose to take my place.  Unfortunately that is one of my super powers.  Worked to my advantage in the hospitals.  I could diagnose the microorganism of infections by smell, long before the lab test cultures came back.

1)  nailing some wire to my garage: I stretched the existing wire mesh back up on to some straight nails, but let Audrey know that the underlying problem of the gravel under the garage sliding down the hill and pulling the wire down is still there. This was not a permanent fix. Next time, I would attach it lower with better-suited nails so it would be firmly attached with some slack to allow for further sliding. Might want to also use a shovel to push back the gravel. It might take a couple hours.

2) fixing a slat on a wooden fence: I fixed the one slat that was obviously loose, but found 2 next to it that will come off soon because the crosspiece that they are attached to is rotted. There is also another in very bad shape on the gate. When I suggested to Audrey that the fence had reached the end of its useful life, she told me that it was installed in 1986.
