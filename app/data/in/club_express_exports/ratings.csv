Lynn seemed happy with the results. I think we found a nice balance between efficiency of direct results on her task list and me listening. However, someone with greater social skills than I have might have to be the judge of that. I did make an effort to not rush. She needed to give the backstory of/apologize for the clutter and was sheepish about asking for help on the bookshelf because it should be simple; Both things we touched on in the volunteer training about reasons why people can find it hard to ask for help.

1)  nailing some wire to my garage: I stretched the existing wire mesh back up on to some straight nails, but let Audrey know that the underlying problem of the gravel under the garage sliding down the hill and pulling the wire down is still there. This was not a permanent fix. Next time, I would attach it lower with better-suited nails so it would be firmly attached with some slack to allow for further sliding. Might want to also use a shovel to push back the gravel. It might take a couple hours.

2) fixing a slat on a wooden fence: I fixed the one slat that was obviously loose, but found 2 next to it that will come off soon because the crosspiece that they are attached to is rotted. There is also another in very bad shape on the gate. When I suggested to Audrey that the fence had reached the end of its useful life, she told me that it was installed in 1986.

Apt still has a strong odor, perhaps a notch below the last visit's odor level.  Litter box was clean.  I think it probably is in the carpets and wherever.  We sat in kitchen because the books have taken over the guest chair in the living room.
She could not remember if she had eaten lunch yet. Naomi was out doing laundry when I first got there, so I was not sure if she should eat or not.  Later, before Naomi left for the day,  Naomi offered her MOW meal that was in refrigerator but S refused.
The forgetfulness was spoken about by S during our conversation.  It was pretty obvious.  She was calling the aide Fay.

On 6/9/17 I went to see SP for a visit.  The smell of ammonia was quite strong when I entered.
SP was fine.  Said she had been snuggling her cat on the bed when I called.  The rugs are still covered in cat hair.  Not sure if the new cleaning service has started yet or not.
We went for a short walk.  Perhaps SP's nose picked up the odor when we reentered the apt.
Thankfully, SP opened the sliding glass door for the last 10 min of the visit.
I thought I could hang in as her visitor until the new cleaner had taken effect but I do not believe I can. 
In the interest of self care of my lungs, I would like to terminate my visits with her.  Perhaps you can find someone who does not have such a sensitive nose to take my place.  Unfortunately that is one of my super powers.  Worked to my advantage in the hospitals.  I could diagnose the microorganism of infections by smell, long before the lab test cultures came back."

Jim had to leave, but the three of us stayed for dinner. Conversations continued. N taught French and still does at LifeLong so she and Hank conversed a little in that.  
N had gone to coffee at Purity the week before. There was only one other person there also. So she thinks she'll wait until fall to attend LLH events. 
I suggested a few other events, but she wasn't interested - really looking for conversations not concerts or dinner. 
Perhaps we, LLH, can talk more about this and see if there is a way to accommodate her need. She invited us to stop and sit on her porch to talk. 
We'll try to do it, but not next week - we're away."

I installed Ann's curtain rod for a basement window from 09:10am to 11:40am.
It went slow technically because of things like moving things to get to it, attaching the rod to the wood frame above the concrete wall up near the the joists, and one side of the curtain being full length with the other half length (that changed the action). We were also chatting about her dog that died recently, her tools and being handy etc.. Do you adopt out grandmothers?



Ann said the deck was painted about 2 or 3 years ago. It still looks pretty good, but the horizontal surface of the deck itself is starting to peel away.  I think this job would/should be more than just power washing and then rolling on some more paint after it is dry. I think the edges of the exposed surface that I saw need to be scraped and primed to hold the next top coat of paint better. It could be a volunteer job from a skills required standpoint, but to do it right might be a large junk of time.

1) Success. Came up with a reasonable number of working lamps.
Most likely that time killed the lamps instead of the movers; maybe one broken bulb, but even that looked blown.
Cut cord on one that had a dimmer rated for 500 Watts, strange bulbs surrounded by mesh cage, and wobbly base.
One beautiful IKEA lamp is solid steel, but faulty switch is almost inaccessible and looked like cords would be too short to match up for a plugin lamp, so I called it scrap metal.

2) Spent second hour looking in toilet flush tanks and explaining how they work, physical defect in seal on downstairs toilet's ""flapper"", and how using the shutoff valve on near the floor every time to avoid the filling sound has the downside that the valve is not meant for that many uses. I asked Lois to call and ask for me for a follow up visit to fix the leak inside the downstairs toilet.

I was unable to fix the overhead door and asked Sonya to call Cortland Overhead Door if she needs that one to work automatically. It is down manually. The other door works fine automatically, but the release to use it manually is stuck.



Ruled out the usual suspects like the safety sensor and found the door to be having a lot of trouble getting around the curved part manually so it looks like the motor is not strong enough to move it.
It worked two weeks ago so may be just related to lower temperatures contracting the track. She said someone had taken it apart previously and put it back together. Time for a professional."

Recommended letting it leak until spring and/or finding the inside isolation and closing it then opening the outside valve to completely drain it.

Looked like an older valve with a consistent leak making a noticeable iceberg under the valve.
The one on another side of the house had already been changed out to a more modern one like another I repaired in the summer at another house. Took a peak in the larger part of the crawl space to try to trace the water line and find an interior isolation valve. No luck. Asked about shutting off the water to the whole house, but John didn't want to do that today (entertaining). I was very hesitant to touch the valve without a shutoff readily available.

John said he would put on some old clothes and go up in the crawlspace himself soon.

So if I get the go ahead from you, I would pick her up at 10:30 on Monday to go to H&R block on triphammer road.  If there is a need to do bills or mail when finished with the taxes, I can do that when we get back.  I’m not sure if she wants more time as she has quite a list of things she wants to get organized.  I suggested we prioritize tasks and just whittle away at it.

Dave is having a real hard time right now dealing with his Alzheimer's Disease and we have an appointment tomorrow with his doctor to see if perhaps a medication change is in order. It sounded to me like he and Dorothy had a nice time together, but he found it to be very over-whelming. We'll keep Dorothy in mind for other visits after the dust settles. She seems willing to work with us and I appreciate the caring and concern the both of you have shown us.

Jean","So I just got back from my visit.. we decided I would come next Monday at 3 for an hour.  Dave has trouble expressing himself and I can see how difficult it would be to “entertain” someone for much longer.  So we shall see how it goes.. might Mary Helen like to do some time since she knows him and he knows her?

So Jean just called and said that Dave had had a bad morning before I came .. and it seemed too much for him to “entertain” me.. he felt as he should and used to do.  I was expecting to just sit and show him my pictures or chat about his life, but he had the game set up and felt he needed to be the host..so she said that they were going to the counselor and maybe change his meds and would get back to me if she thought it was time.

We tried.. I thought it went fine, but he felt exhausted even though I did not see it...so I guess he was a successful host if that was his goal.  He is stuck in a bad place for sure."

I plan to return to help with bills next wed the 18th from 1-3:30.
I did talk with Joyce yesterday about the time I can commit to which is about 3 hours each week to mostly help with mail and bills.  I can offer a little more time on occasion but not regularly. I think she had another person taking her out often and that has not been happening as much lately.  I suggested she call LLH to see if there might be someone available to help her with some of the errands.  
Joyce also shared that her vision has decreased a good deal in The past 6-8 weeks.  She has seen her doc regarding this and has someone coming soon to evaluate her needs at home.   I have seen a change in Her ability to see things .  I think she will need more support at home in the future for her to be safe.
Thanks,
Wendy"

     Lois and I thoroughly enjoyed shopping at Aldi's Thursday morning.  I think she'd like to go every two weeks or so and, because I will be hors d'combat for a month or more, it would be good to find someone else to help. Because she doesn't see really well, she needed help reading some of the labels and reaching items on the top shelf but otherwise, she's mighty capable.  She jokingly calls me her personal shopper...but she did the shopping.

Thank you for the calla lilies. Are there any special storing instructions? Do you cover them in peat moss or just store as is ?  Just in the basement or should they be colder?

Sounds like pool is improving......

Expecting you again next Monday the 19th and then we'll look forward to pics of your travels. Dave like the idea.

I really appreciate all you have done for us over the past few months. 

Jean","I always think I will email you about the day, and when I get home..stuff happens and I forget.. 

We like to start out our visit with chatting .. I love hearing about his younger days and not much repetition either.  Next week I am going to hear about how you two met if you don’t mind.  After about half an hour he gets tired of talking so we head to the pool table.  I think we both are improving.  The place we go in AZ has a pool table in the club house..may have to practice a bit over the winter.

I store the bulbs in newspaper, but not sure it is necessary.. just in a cool place like basement is good.

Yes, we have your name on our travel list.. so you can follow as we go. 

Wag More, Bark Less

Turns out that what she wanted was the screens taken out of 2 windows and replaced with the glass window that acts as a storm window.  Unfortunately the only access to these 2 windows was to get on a low sloped roof that was covered with 4"" of snow.  We jointly decided that this job would have to wait until the snow melted off of the roof.  I told her to send a new request to LLH when the snow is gone since I cannot predict when I might be available.  She understood and was apologetic that I drove to her house for naught."

I kept asking Joyce if it was ok for me to help her, and she said yes, but I wasn't comfortable asking her about her sex for example.

She is having problems with iron bacteria and the best way to resolve this is to cleanse her cold water pipes in the house with chlorox.

I have the same problem and I solved my problem this way and have had no iron bacteria problems for 5 years!!

Ended up taking 4 boxes of shoes and 4 bags of clothes out of the house then.
Just got back from the Salvation Army dropping the stuff off.


I think the main plumbing issue that should be handled soon is the kitchen sink that leaks (the only working sink).

It looks like the neighbor/tenant from upstairs put clear caulk around the kitchen faucet to control the water, but that is directing the water behind and under the sink. Some of that water is being caught in containers under the sink, but more seems to be soaking the cabinet and flooring and shows mold down in the basement. I think I can replace the faucet leaving the sink in place.


Light bulbs look pretty straight forward.
Mary had forgotten that one on the landing had actually been broken off until after she tried the switch.

The bad news is that CFCU charged her $38 for every check they declined and even charged her twice for one check.  We tried to find out today if those checks had ever been honored but ran out of time and energy.  So she'll go back to the bank (she was there on Friday) with Jay and try to sort it out.  Phew!

She had asked if we could drop off her CPAP mask at Professional Home Care.  The wrong one had been sent to her.  We did and met with Melissa Clark, the respiratory therapist who had helped us on April 29.  After about an hour, Bettie had the correct mask and I took her home.  It was good that I had taken her there before and that I was familiar with her machine.  I put Bettie's food purchases away and went home.

When I picked him up at 2:45, he was quite proud of the fact that he was able to go shopping the same day as being released. He wasn’t too pleased with the Beechtree situation but managed to carry on.
When I arrived, I waved to him.  He was chatting with two others.  It was clearly hard for him to break off that conversation to get into the car, even though another vehicle was patiently waiting for us to move on.
When I picked him up at 3:40, he said that his shopping routine had been somewhat difficult.  The first young man assigned to him allegedly knew nothing about where particular items were located, and he was soon replaced by a much more helpful woman.
Our trip back to McGraw House was uneventful.  When we arrived, Randy said he would go in and get their shopping cart to take his goods up to his apartment.  I waited and waited.  Frankly, I thought he had met someone in the lobby and was chatting again.  Finally, a"

Ended up taking the one air conditioner that had been ""removed"" back up from the basement to see if it still worked.
Don indicated that Pete had let it drop to the ground outside. The dirt caked in bits of it backed that up.
That was the brand new AC. Good news is that the compressor still came on and only minor damage to the outside happened."

She did get somewhat agitated at the appointment because she was really confused about what the woman was telling her, although it was more likely that Bettie's memory was at fault--what the woman was saying made sense to me.  When we got back to her house she wanted me to come in while she went through the process of setting up the machine, which gave her a few minor difficulties.
It was a lot to deal with!  But Bettie is always very appreciative.
I did realize when I got home that her bag with her other shoes was still in my car, I didn't see it when I got her other things to bring into the house.  I will drop them by sometime tomorrow.
I can't help her out on Friday, I have a contractor coming to the house to do a job.

When I called Randy last evening to confirm this morning’s pick-up, he had no knowledge of this appointment.  He was well aware of the appointment scheduled for this afternoon, but not for this morning with the orthopedic group.

When we got to CMA, I went in with Randy to confirm that he did indeed have an appointment.  The receptionist said it was with Dr. Roche, not Dr. Blake.  When Randy was called into the examination area I inquired as to how long it would probably take. The medical assistant said that she didn’t know and that it would depend on what would be found by Dr. Roche.  End result: I stayed with Randy for his examination which went very well.

There should be no problem this afternoon."

I talked with her yesterday afternoon and got her shopping list.  I told her that I would shop today after 2:00 PM.  I expected to deliver her groceries at 3:30 PM or later.

I went to Aldi’s, Green Star, and Wegman’s shopping only for her with a long list.  Stores were fairly busy.  I finished at 4:00 PM and just got to my car when my cell rang.  Natasha was worried that something happened to me because I did not call her at 3:30 PM.  I tried to explain that I was fine.  She does not seem to process when I tell her that I am not sure when I will finish shopping.  This has happened before and I don’t know how to solve the problem.  At 94 I understand that she worries about everything.  

I called her back at 4:05 PM and delivered the groceries at 4:15 PM, getting home at 4:30 PM, too tired for Happy Hour.""-Carol Scheele"

She called me to tell me that she would not be home Tuesday afternoon (eye appointment in Syracuse).  I called her in the evening for her list.  She also wanted stamps with flowers.  The last time I was at the post office, I got extra stamps with this in mind. 

Natasha had a call from the agency that gives SNAP benefits to tell her that she had a lot of money accumulating on her SNAP card.  Natasha had no idea.  She wondered if I would take her card and pin and begin using it.  After Cheryl explained the process to me, I stopped at Natasha's before shopping yesterday and used the card at all three stores:  Aldi's, GreenStar, and Wegman's.  Not all items were covered.  Natasha gave me a check to cover them.  Shopping was a success."

She was happy with the work done the day he was in her home and did not feel uncomfortable and reports his behavior was appropriate at this time.  A few days later Kent texted Diana stating that he had a few ideas for her railing project, Diana responded that she wasn't too concerned about the railings at this time.  Kent sent a second text some time later asking whether Diana was interested in meeting new people and if she would like to go for a walk sometime.  Diana never responded to this text and feels uncomfortable that he contacted her in this manner.  Dianna expressed her concern to Cassie Besemer and stated that she would not like Kent to assist her with any future projects and that she was concerned he may make similar advances with other women.  Cassie Besemer reported this complaint to Cheryl Jewell on 3/2/2021.","""I put together Diana's raised be on Monday, approx 30 minutes, and assessed her railing project, which would be a 8-12 hour project.

""I went an looked at the windows yesterday. One was badly broken with parts like a broken spring literally falling out of it. Nothing I could do there. Fixed one by unbending one retention hole so they can have the outside glass stay up. Found strange greasy residue in a few windows and Kusum said she had been trying to lubricate with vegetable oil. Advised her to stop doing that and clean the tracks with a little Dawn dish washing liquid. Also found one window track filled with rocks from potted plant she kept in the window. Asked her to vacuum those out. Overall, none of the windows were stuck for me, but I did notice that the placement of objects in the room near the windows was extremely unhelpful to get leverage to use them...they were also trying to just open them by arm strength across their bodies with arm outstretched. Tried to demonstrate a whole-body opening strategy with the arm stationary and the legs/torso doing the work.""- Chris Dunham"
