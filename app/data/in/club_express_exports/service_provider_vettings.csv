She is a neighbor and a friend, and in all these years I have known her to be a calm and thoughtful person, friendly, good tempered, kind, and always willing to help others. I believe she will do very well with older adults. She has often travelled to take care of her aging mother, and has spoken of her mother as well as of other older adults with affection; always willing to spend the time to care for them. This includes her aunt, as well as an older friend she often spends time with. I’m happy to answer any other questions you may have. My phone number is 607-220-8142."

Sandra is thoughtful, generous, patient, funny and intelligent; and her principles and ethics are outstanding. I have seen Sandra help many people (including me) with her friendship and willing to give to others in need.
 
Sandra would be a wonderful volunteer in your organization. She has told me about her interest in serving people in need many times in the past, but her work kept her too busy.  Happily, now it is the perfect time for her to devote time and effort to your wonderful organization. I strongly recommend her and I would be delighted to more talk about Sandra when I am back in Ithaca this coming Monday 2/14.

Jan and my wife and I are in a group that goes once a month to the nursing home “Cayuga Ridge”
to sing old songs with the people there, with Jan accompanying on his guitar.
They know us well by now, and they sing along and joke with us for the hour we are there.

I want to give her a terrible reference so that we can keep her for ourselves, but I can’t! She’s fantastic. She is very dedicated, passionate, digs in, learns what she needs to do to get it done, then gets it done. She’s very knowledgeable about the community and about organizations and boards. She’s done a lot of programmatic work for NAMI but also a lot of organizational work such as dragging NAMI Finger Lakes through the new NAMI National rules for local affiliates. And she’s warm, caring, kind, and a wonderful person. You can’t go wrong with her.

"Jean Poland","Yes","Reference Check",,,"Hi Cheryl, 
Thank you for reaching out.  I just love Jean!  She has done so much for NAMI Fingerlakes, we are going to dearly miss her when she completes her 9 years on our board this March.  I meet Jean seven years ago when I attended my first support group meeting.  She was so welcoming, supportive and understanding.  She is the reason I become so involved with NAMI. Without her dedication, mentorship and continued support NAMI Fingerlakes would not be what it is today. Her kindness, coupled with excellent commutation skills makes her a great fit for any organization lucky to have her in their ranks.

I would highly recommend Paulette for a volunteer position at Love Living at Home.  Paulette is a very responsible and hardworking person.  You can totally depend on her and with any task given to her, she gives it her all.  She is also very caring and compassionate and would likely find a great deal of fulfillment in helping seniors.  She interacts easily with people and I think seniors would find her very comfortable to be with. 

 

I think Paulette would make a terrific volunteer for Love Living at Home.

In addition to being a very intelligent individual, who has had a lot of life experience in terms of conversing and communicating with others, I find him to be at base a very kind individual, who willingly offers to help others whenever he can.  For instance, he has consistently helped me with repairs to my home, and recently he has been extremely helpful and generous in playing a role on behalf of my wife who has suffered a disability that prevented her from driving to doctors and therapy appointments.

I teach 4th grade at Belle Sherman Elementary School and ""Mr. Dave"" has been a volunteer in my class for at least 6 years, maybe longer. We had to take a break when schools closed due to Covid and I taught virtually. Dave is smart, dependable, and culturally sensitive. I teach a diverse class with many students who are learning English. Mr. Dave is sensitive to their needs and great at fostering relationships and helping students with their school work. Mr. Dave enjoys solving tricky problems and developing projects and hands-on activities for the children. I think he would be equally good with older adults! Dave Stipanuk is kind, respectful, and helpful. Dave Stipanuk would be an asset to your organization."
"David Stipanuk","Yes","Reference Check",,"Joseph Volpe","I met Mr. Dave, as he is known at Belle Sherman Elementary school, about 5-6 years ago. He would come into my 4th grade classroom multiple times a week to volunteer. 

Mr. Dave was a jack of all trades in the classroom. He could lead groups of students in a variety of subjects (math, science, special students, reading, writing, you name it), he would work and tutor a student one on one, he would participate in whole class activities answering and asking questions and he was eager to help setup and clean up activities as well as grade student work. Literally however he could help, he would.

The most impressive thing about Mr. Dave was how willing he was to help solve a problem. It seems like every time he came in he would have a new idea about how to help a particular student or the entire class.

I must admit he mostly worked with 10 year olds and even though his work with students went very well, I rarely observed him working with adults besides collaborating very well with me"

I kid you not, Maddie is the kindest, sweetest, most thoughtful person I have ever met. She goes above and beyond to send thank you cards whenever possible, her true joy is planning birthday celebrations, and she is overall just a really great reliable human. Once you meet her in person you will understand – her warm & bubbly personality is so infectious. I would recommend her as a volunteer because of her incredibly positive personality and her reliability. Maddie doesn’t let people down. She can’t sleep at night if she owes someone an email response, for example. You can count on Maddie to be an exceptional volunteer for your organization.
